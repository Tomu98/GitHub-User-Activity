# GitHub User Activity

A simple CLI tool that allows you to query the recent activity of any user on GitHub. Through the GitHub API, it shows you many events such as commits, pull requests, issues created, starred repositories, and more.

This project is inspired by an idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), a platform that offers community-created roadmaps, best practices, projects ideas and resources that help people grow in their technology careers.

Specific inspiration for this project comes from the following link: [GitHub User Activity in roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)
